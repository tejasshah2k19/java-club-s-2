when we need a variable which value is fix/constant. 
No 1 allow to change that value. 
the ans is final variable. 

final int X = 10; 
by convention final variable should be in all CAPS.

You must assign value to your final variable. 
You can also assign value using constructor.


----------------------------------------------------------

inheritance :- 
	what is inheritance ? why we need ? 
	object of one class can access property of another class.
	one class can access property[variable and methods]  from another class. 
	
	1)Parent - Child - SingleLevel Inheritance 
	
	*) Create Staff class with name and empcode variable.
		create input() for scan all variable of Staff Class.
		Now Create Faculty class who is child of Staff class.
		FAculty has salary and rank field. 
		to read rank and salary we need to create input() in 
		Faculty class. 
		To print all the information of faculty create 
		display(). 
		
		from main method create 1 faculty , read input and print 
		all information of faculty. 

----------------------------------------------------------




create parent abstract class staff with two method salary() and 
tax() 
salary method is abstract method and tax is non abstract. 

create child class Faculty that inherit property from Staff class 
child class has 1 method subject() 

demonstrate above structure and create object(s) 
and call all the methods
